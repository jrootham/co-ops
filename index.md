    <h2>Let’s Make Housing Feel Human Again</h2>
    <p>Toronto’s housing system is broken. We’re overdue for a new model. 
      <br/> What if we build one ourselves?</p>
    <p>We have a model to create Toronto housing that is <strong>permanently affordable</strong>, <strong>community-governed</strong>, and <strong>built to last</strong>.</p>
    <p>The approach uses <strong>multiplex cooperatives</strong> to add more homes, <em>not more landlords</em>.</p>
    <p><strong>And you’re invited.</strong></p>
